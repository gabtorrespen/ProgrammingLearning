# Programming Learning

This is a .NET solution that provides an environment for learning and implementing various data structures, algorithms, and coding challenges. The goal of this solution is to facilitate hands-on practice and exploration of fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Structure
The solution is structured using the multiple project approach, where each project represents a separate component or area of the project. This structure promotes modularity, separation of concerns, and easier management of the codebase.

### DataStructures Project
The **DataStructures** project contains implementations of various data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. Each data structure is defined in its own class within this project. These implementations serve as a foundation for understanding the underlying principles and operations of different data structures. 

### Algorithms Project
The **Algorithms** project focuses on implementing and studying various algorithms, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and more. Each algorithm is implemented in its own class and classified in a specific folder based on the algorithm purpose or subject. This project enables experimentation with algorithmic techniques and understanding their efficiency and applications.

### CodingChallenges Project
The **CodingChallenges** project provides a collection of coding challenges for practice and application of data structures and algorithms. There is a specific class for every possible subject and multiple methods defined for each challenge. It allows you to develop problem-solving skills, apply different algorithms and data structures, and evaluate the effectiveness of your solutions.

### UnitTesting Project
The **UnitTesting** project contains unit tests for validating the correctness of data structures, algorithms and coding challenge solutions. It uses NUnit as testing framework to define test classes and test methods. This project helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of your implementations.

## Getting Started
To get started with the solution:

1. Clone or download the solution to your local development environment.
2. Open the solution in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build the solution to resolve any dependencies.
4. Explore the projects and their respective folders to understand the organization of the codebase.
5. Run the unit tests in the **UnitTesting** project to validate the correctness of the coding challenge solutions.

Happy learning and coding!
